# svg-zoom-test

### A test-project mainly for zooming and panning on a SVG


* Zoom; mouse-wheel-scroll to and from the cursor location
* Pan; hold down middle mouse-button and drag the SVG around
* Left-click to add a point to the SVG 
* Drag the point by grabbing it and moving it around
* Simplified store pattern (not vuex) with direct mutations for quick development...
* Visible and, to an extent, editable Viewbox and zoom-variables
* CSS Grid for layout
